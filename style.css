You may be thinking…

WHOA, WHOA, WHOA…WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

But before you freak out, let me take a minute to explain how
to get this working.


Your two main files are:

1. style.less
	— ties everything together. 
	— includes all of the _partial files, at the appropriate
	time, via media queries.

2. _base.less
	— this is the main part you need to get your head around
	— this theme is mobile first. Hence, everything starts with _base and builds from there. 
	— you essentially override or add to the base styles as you go up in viewport
